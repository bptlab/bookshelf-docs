# How to give a scientific presentation

* It's all about the audience
    * What would be of interest for them in your presentation? / What do they expect from you?
    * What is their background?
* Structure (general)
    1. Motivation
    1. My work
        1. Algorithm
        1. Implementation
        1. Evaluation
    1. Conclusion
* If you need an outline, make it specific, taylor it to your needs
* 1 Slide = 1 Thought (use storyboarding: sketch slide titles, arrange)
* Don't try to tell everything ... Make a choice what to omit
* Use examples (When time is short, omit the general case, not the example)
* 7 +/- 2 points per slide (including pictures, title, ...)
* Summary slide (> 5min presentations, key ideas as "selling ideas")
* Backup slides for answering questions (to pretend to be prepared, use for expected questions)
* Keep the usual stuff in mind (no text, font size, contrast, indentation level, spelling mistakes, animations, visualize data, show enthusiasm, eye contact, gestures, voice, know location, introduction/end -> summarization slides, time)
* Picture complex algorithms, processes, ... with Modeling Notations
* Guide questions to hidden slides

## Intermediate (Topic) presentation
1. Topic & Background
    * Challenges
    * Motivation
1. Approach (main part)

## Meta
* Never translate your own slides (English slides = English spoken, Deutsch slides = Deutsch spoken)
* Provide all necessary background information (Case Management? Chimera/Unicorn?)
* Presentation in A.1-2, check the quality of the projector!
* Presentation (20 minutes) + Q&A (10 minutes)
* Present in English
